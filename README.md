## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
Obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric condition often comorbid with depression.  
This project explores how **depression** and **age** moderate compulsion severity and type in OCD patients.  

Specifically, I investigated:  
- **Compulsion type Ã— Depression diagnosis**  
- **Depression Ã— Age interaction effects**  
- Other demographic moderators (gender, ethnicity, marital status, education, family history)

## ðŸ§ª Methods  
- **Tools**: R, tidyverse, ANOVA, regression modeling, emmeans  
- **Outcome**: Y-BOCS compulsion severity scores  
- **Predictors**: Compulsion type, depression diagnosis, age, demographics  
- **Visualizations**: ggplot2

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings  
- **Compulsion type Ã— Depression**  
  - Without depression: ordering compulsions > checking (p = .038)  
  - With depression: praying compulsions > checking (p = .042)  

- **Depression Ã— Age**  
  - Younger (<40): non-depressed slightly higher severity  
  - Older (40+): depressed patients showed greater severity  
  - Interaction significant at p = .030 (vs p = .039 for depression alone)  

- Other demographics showed no significant effects.
